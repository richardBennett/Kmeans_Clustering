# KMeans Clustering for Virus Detection
A program for determining network attacks based on a set of network connections. This was actually a school project for 599 but the teacher while awesome wasn't very clear in what exactly was going on.  However I completed it and it was fun but I'm keeping it up just in case anyone ever finds it useful.
